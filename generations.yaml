    description: "The Toyota Grand Highlander represents a strategic expansion of Toyota's SUV lineup, positioned between the standard Highlander and the larger, more premium Sequoia. Addressing feedback that the regular Highlander's third-row space was insufficient for families needing room for adults or teenagers, the Grand Highlander adds approximately 6.5 inches of overall length and 4 inches of wheelbase, resulting in significantly improved third-row accommodations and cargo capacity. Exterior styling is distinct from the standard Highlander with a more upright, squared-off design featuring a prominent front grille, horizontal-themed lighting elements, and a floating roof effect created by blacked-out pillars. Available with three powertrain options: a 2.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing 265 horsepower, a conventional hybrid system combining a 2.5-liter four-cylinder with electric motors for 243 total horsepower, and a Hybrid MAX performance-oriented system pairing a 2.4-liter turbocharged engine with electric motors for 362 combined horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque. All configurations feature an eight-speed automatic transmission, with front-wheel drive standard and all-wheel drive optional (standard on Hybrid MAX). The interior emphasizes premium comfort with features including heated and ventilated first and second-row seats, a panoramic moonroof, and a power-folding third row, while technology includes a standard 12.3-inch touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, an available 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, and a full suite of Toyota Safety Sense 3.0 driver assistance features. Practical features include up to seven USB ports throughout the cabin, a refrigerated center console on higher trims, and a maximum cargo capacity of 98 cubic feet with all seats folded. With towing capacity of up to 5,000 pounds, seating for up to eight passengers, and significantly improved space for both passengers and cargo compared to the standard Highlander, the Grand Highlander aims to address the needs of growing families seeking three-row versatility without stepping up to the larger, truck-based Sequoia."
